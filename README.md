## 📢 &nbsp; Weekly Check-Ins

Each week I will summarize my activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going.  
Use the prompts below as a guide on what to write about.

### Week 1

⚙️ Overview - What I worked on this past week

Created a math module with functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (with error handling), square root, and finding the maximum of two numbers.
A file operations module for creating, reading, updating, and deleting files, using Node.js' fs module.
I also wrote unit tests for both modules, ensuring that the math operations worked correctly and that file operations behaved as expected.
🌵 Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
Handling errors in file operations: Initially, when testing file operations, I ran into issues where some test cases didn’t properly handle file paths or cleanup between tests. To resolve this, I ensured that every file operation used the correct paths and included proper cleanup after tests.
Error handling in math operations: For division, I ran into issues with edge cases like dividing by zero. I addressed this by adding error handling and validating inputs to make the code more robust.
🏆 Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
This week, I made significant progress in writing unit tests for non-trivial modules, particularly around error handling and validation. I also improved my ability to implement synchronous file operations and make them testable with assertions.

🔮 Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next
I will work on adding more edge case handling to both the math and file operation modules, ensuring that they work in a wider range of scenarios.
I also plan to dive deeper into mocking in tests, particularly with the fs module, to make the tests more isolated and easier to run without relying on real file systems.
