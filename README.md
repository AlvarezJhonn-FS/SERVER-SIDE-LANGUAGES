POKEMON FETCHER

The Pokémon Data Fetcher, fetches detailed information about a random Pokémon from the PokeAPI. The script retrieves data such as the Pokémon's name, height, weight, types, flavor text, habitat, and whether it is legendary. It does this by making two asynchronous API calls—one for the Pokémon's basic data and another for its species-related information.
