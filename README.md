## 📢 &nbsp; Weekly Check-Ins

Each week I will summarize my activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going.  
Use the prompts below as a guide on what to write about.      

⚙️ Overview - What I worked on this past week
<br>
🌵 Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

<br>

### Week 1

⚙️ Overview - This week, I focused on implementing a simple RESTful API using Node.js, Express, and Postman for testing. The goal was to develop the basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and persist data in a JSON file using the file system (fs module). My work mainly involved:

Setting up routes to handle POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE requests.
Using the fs module to read and write data to a local JSON file.
Handling edge cases, such as trying to access or modify data that doesn’t exist.
I also spent time testing the API with Postman to ensure everything was functioning correctly.

<br>
🌵 Challenges - I initially faced challenges with data persistence in the JSON file. Since the app was supposed to store data locally and I was using the fs module to read and write, I encountered issues where the data wasn’t being saved correctly after modifications.
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - I leveled up my understanding of using the fs module to read, write, and update data in files asynchronously, which is an essential skill for backend development when dealing with persistent data storage.
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - I plan to add more validation to the data input and improve the error handling for different scenarios (e.g., missing fields or invalid data types). This will make the API more user-friendly and less prone to errors
